Hello connections! ðŸ‘‹
I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my task for the Machine Learning Virtual Internship with @CODSOFT
The task I worked on was [Task Name, e.g., SPAM SMS DETECTION].
Goal: To build a model that can [Briefly explain the goal, e.g., classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate].
Model Used: [E.g., Naive Bayes Classifier / Logistic Regression] 
Key Result: Achieved an [E.g., Accuracy of 98.7%].
This experience has been great for learning [ text preprocessing and model evaluation].
Check out the screen recording below for a quick demo of the model in action!
Grateful for this opportunity. Feedback is welcome!
